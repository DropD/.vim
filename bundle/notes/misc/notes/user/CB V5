Scoring matrix 
   → similarity scores (biological information)
   → Penalty - Levenstein
     • ID   = 0
     • Diff = 1
     • Del  = 1
     [above alignment: Levenstein penlty = 3] 

→ optimize sum of scores
→ penalize gaps
→ exponential number of possible alignments

string s1, s2
optimal alignment of s1, s2 -> example: see paper

alignment of GENUG and ENOUGH -> see paper

finding score by means of dynamic programming: forward phase
finding alignment by backtracking:             backward phase

Optimal alignment may not be unique. In case of ambiguity, make a decision. 
Don’t try to return all optimal alignments (their number increases exponentially with every ambiguity)!

Time  = O(nm)
Space = O(min(n, m))

DP alignment using Dayhoff scores => maximum likelihood alignment
