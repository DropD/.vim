update: 
I just try my best to enhance this script as follows:
1) better syntax highlight. 
2) indent support (just use the css indent file is enough actually. >.<).
3) auto compile file.less to file.css, and echo any errors if you have lessc installed.

The script is now available on github. https://github.com/KohPoll/vim-less.git

I just begin to use less(http://lesscss.org). It can help us to write css more productivity. 
But I just can not find a less syntax file for vim, so I wrote a simple one.
I am just new to vim, and this is the very first script for vim I've written. 
Just take your decision.
